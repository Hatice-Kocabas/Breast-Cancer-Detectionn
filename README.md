# Breast-Cancer-Detectionn
This repository contains a classification model that uses data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) to test whether breast cancer is benign or malignant.

Two different models were created: Random Forest and Logistic Regression. As more accurate results were obtained, the final model was created using the logistic regression model.
